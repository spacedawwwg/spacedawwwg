### Raised in Cumbria. Made in Manchester.

My name is Paul Welsh (also known as Spacedawwwg to the Internet). I'm Director and Principal Consultant of Nonbreakingspace, a small digital studio,  based in Manchester (UK), specialising in UI development and Javascript based architecture, with a strong focus on accessibilty. I've been designing and developing digital solutions since 2005.

As a hands-on Director, I oversee all aspects of design and development within the company. From in-house identity and interaction design consultancy to solutions architecture, standards and UI builds. Working directly with clients allows me to understand their goals and user requirements, helping them to deliver a successful project.
